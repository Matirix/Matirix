🎓 I'm a BCIT Computer Science Graduate with a focus in Cloud Computing, Full-stack and Mobile Development!

💼 My professional experience as a Software Engineer is in developing Mobile Applications using Flutter and React Native! 

🪑 During my academic years, I was the Downtown Chair for the BCIT Student Association, where I led mental health initiatives and advocated for the Downtown Students!

🏆 One of my biggest accomplishments were winning the 2023 YVR Hackathon and becoming the Winter 2024 Valedictorian!

🏋️‍♂️ Outside of professional activities, I'm an avid reader of both non-fic and fiction! I like to maintain an active lifestyle with outdoor hikes and plain ol' gyming.
